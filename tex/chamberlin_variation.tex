   A variation of the Chamberlin trimetric map projection is presented, termed
   the matrix trimetric projection. The matrix trimetric projection amounts to a
   linear transformation of the squares of the distances between a given point
   and three control points. The formula of the forward projection is simpler
   than the Chamberlin projection, making it nearly twice as fast to calculate.
   The matrix trimetric projection has an inverse formula requires numerical
   iteration of only one parameter. Comparisons between the two projections are
   made using a representative list of control points. The Chamberlin trimetric
   projection outperforms the matrix trimetric projection on measures of angle
   deformation and scale deformation, but the reverse is true for a measure of
   distance deformation, and the difference between the results of the
   projections is small. Considered all together, the matrix trimetric
   projection is a viable alternative for the use cases of the Chamberlin
   trimetric projection.

\section{Introduction}
Any map projection must introduce some form of distortion. In particular, no
map projection can be both conformal (angle-preserving) and equal-area.
Projections that eliminate one form of distortion often introduce a great deal
of another form of distortion. For example, many conformal projections
drastically enlarge some areas compared to others, most notoriously the Mercator
projection, but also the stereographic and the Lambert conformal conic
projections. \citep{snyder87} A compromise map projection is one that seeks to
balance different kinds of distortion; allowing small amounts of different kinds
of distortion can produce a map that is more aesthetically pleasing.

The Chamberlin trimetric projection (CTP) is such a compromise map projection.
It is named for Wellman Chamberlin, a chief cartographer for the National
Geographic Society, which has published wall and atlas maps using his
projection. The CTP is appropriate for mapping whole continents and large
portions of continents. \citep{christensen} It may be thought of as a form of
triangulation. Most often, the CTP is used with the spherical approximation of
the Earth. Being a compromise projection, the CTP does
not perfectly preserve angle, area, or distance. For most practical ellipsoids,
distortions due to the spherical approximation are negligible compared to
distortions due to the projection itself.

The CTP is based on a simple geometric construction, using three arbitrary
points on the sphere called the control points. Algebraic formulas are preferred
for modern computerized GIS, and the formulas for the CTP are somewhat involved.
This is presented in \citet{christensen}, and can be seen in the source code to
its implementation in \citet{proj}; the algorithmic form has branching logic
depending on where the given point lies with respect to the geodesics between
control points, and when the given point lies near a control point.

This text presents a new map projection called the matrix trimetric projection
(MTP) as an alternative to the CTP. A geometric construction related to the
CTP results in a map projection that is similar but has a simpler formula. This
formula is a closed-form matrix function of the squares of the distances, and
allows for a tractable inverse. As the derivations involve matrices and linear
algebra, refer to a text such as \citet{strang80} if needed.

\section{Preliminaries}
These projections will almost always be implemented using the spherical
approximation, so formulas for that approximation are given shortly, and we'll
refer to ``the sphere'' instead of ``the ellipsoid''. That said, the forward
formulas for the CTP and MTP are agnostic of the surface to be projected,
depending only on the result of the distance function.

Points on the sphere are denoted $\mathbf v$ or subscripted versions.
$\mathbf v$ is a 3-vector with unit length, such that it lies on the unit
sphere. Using this vector form allows us to take advantage of linear algebra.
Points specified by latitude $\varphi$ and longitude $\lambda$
can be converted to a unit vector as so:\citep{kent}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf v =
\begin{bmatrix*}
  x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix*}
=
\begin{bmatrix*}
 \cos(\varphi) \cos(\lambda) \\
 \cos(\varphi) \sin(\lambda) \\
 \sin(\varphi)
\end{bmatrix*}.
\end{equation}
The reverse conversion is:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
  \varphi =& \arctan\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{y^2 + x^2}}\right), \\
  \lambda =& \arctan\left(y, x\right),
\end{split}\end{equation}
where the 2-variable form of $\arctan$, commonly called \texttt{arctan2} or
\texttt{atan2} in numeric software libraries, is used for $\lambda$.

One statement of the distance function on the sphere is
\begin{equation}
d\left(\mathbf v_i, \mathbf v_j\right)
= R \arccos\left(\mathbf v_i \cdot \mathbf v_j\right)
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the radius of the Earth. There are equivalent functions in terms
of vectors that are more numerically stable for certain range of arguments,
but this is the form used in the derivations.

Points in the Euclidean plane are denoted by $\mathbf p = [x, y]$ and
subscripted versions. Planar distances are found using the usual
Euclidean norm: $\|\mathbf p_a - \mathbf p_b\|$.

Let $\mathbf v_1$, $\mathbf v_2$, $\mathbf v_3$ be control points on the
sphere, in counter-clockwise order, and let $\mathbf V$ be the matrix having
$\mathbf v_i$ as its $i$th column. Let $\mathbf p_1$ etc. be the control points
on the plane, in corresponding order, and $\mathbf P$ be the matrix having
$\mathbf p_i$ as its $i$th column. The triangles with vertices at $\mathbf v_i$
or $\mathbf p_i$ are called the control triangles: spherical or planar control
triangle, respectively, if the distinction is important. For this paper,
very small triangles are excluded, as are triangles with areas of an entire
hemisphere or more; neither are typical use cases for the CTP.
Note that the planar control triangle is \textbf{not} the image of the
spherical control triangle under either projection! That image is
slightly larger, containing the planar control triangle, and has curved edges.

For both projections, $\mathbf p_i$ must be arranged such that
$d\left(\mathbf v_i, \mathbf v_j\right) = \|\mathbf p_i - \mathbf p_j\|$
for all $i$ and $j$ in $\{1, 2, 3\}$: the spherical length of the edges of the
spherical control triangle are equal to the Euclidean lengths of the planar
control triangles. Without loss of generality, also assume that
$\|\mathbf p_i\|$ is the same for all $i$, such that the circumcenter of the
control triangle lies at the origin. This just removes a translation in the
plane in order to simplify the formula for the MTP; false northing and easting
can be added later. Given $\mathbf v_i$, $\mathbf p_i$ can be constructed as
follows. Let $i, j, k$ be a cyclic permutation of $\{1, 2, 3\}$,
and let $s_k = d\left(\mathbf v_i, \mathbf v_j\right)$,
such that side $k$ with length $s_k$ is opposite point $k$. The circumradius
of the Euclidean triangle with sides of length $s_k$ is \citep{isaacs}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:circumradius}
  C = \frac{\prod_i s_i}{\sqrt{\sum_i 2 s_i^2 s_{i+1}^2 - s_i^4}}.
\end{equation}
From the (Euclidean) law of cosines,
the interior angle $\phi_i$ at each vertex is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phi}
  \phi_i = \arccos \left( \frac{s_k^2 + s_j^2 - s_i^2}{2 s_k s_j}\right).
\end{equation}
Then a set of points satisfying the requirements are given as so:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:planarctrlpts}
  \mathbf P = \begin{bmatrix*}[r]
  C \cos \left(2 \phi_2 \right) &
  C \cos \left(2 \phi_1 \right) &
  C \\
  C \sin \left(2 \phi_2 \right) &
  -C \sin \left(2 \phi_1 \right) &
  0 \\
\end{bmatrix*}.
\end{equation}
These points can be rotated about the origin as desired. Note that some
intermediate values in Equation \ref{eq:circumradius} may be large. This
should not cause a problem on modern computers using common geographic
units of distance, but some special applications may need to scale these
values to avoid overflow.

\section{Forward projection}
Figure \ref{fig:chamberlin} shows the geometric construction of the CTP and the
MTP. We start with the CTP. Let $\mathbf v$ denote the point to project, and
let $r_i = d(\mathbf v_i, \mathbf v)$ be the true distances from each control
point to $\mathbf v$. On the sphere, Figure \ref{fig:chamberlin}a shows the
control triangle with vertices $\mathbf v_i$, the given point $\mathbf v$, and
circles of radius $r_i$ centered on $\mathbf v_i$ and passing through
$\mathbf v$. Moving to the plane, Figure \ref{fig:chamberlin}b shows circles of
the same radius $r_i$ centered on $\mathbf p_i$. The circles appear to all
intersect at a single point, but due to the difference in curvature between the
sphere and the plane they in fact form a small triangle with curved edges, as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:chamberlin}c. In the time of manual plotters the exact
definition of this point was less important, but \citet{christensen} and modern
implementations (e.g. \citealp{proj}) use the centroid of the small triangle,
denoted $\mathbf p_c$.
Note that each pair of circles intersects in (at most) two points,
so the algorithm must choose which point makes up the small triangle.
In \citet{christensen} this is done by comparing the azimuths between each pair
of control points to the azimuths from each control point to the given point.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{construction}
  \caption{Construction of the CTP and MTP. Plot 1a is in equirectangular
  projection. Plot 1b is the projection to the plane. Plot 1c is the same as
  plot 1b, zoomed in to the small triangle created by the three circles.
  $\mathbf p_c$ is the point projected by the CTP and $\mathbf p_m$ is the
  point projected by the MTP. Green solid lines indicate the control
  triangles, the circles are blue dots, and the perpendiculars are red dashes.}
  \label{fig:chamberlin}
\end{figure}

Construction of the MTP starts like the CTP. If one draws a line through the two
points of intersection of each pair of circles, that line is perpendicular to
the triangle edge. These are the dashed red lines in Figure
\ref{fig:chamberlin}b and c. The three lines, one for each pair of circles,
appear to meet at a single point; this observation can be proven with a simple
triangle theorem sometimes attributed to Carnot. (\citealp{posamentier};
\citealp{wohlgemuth}) This point is denoted $\mathbf p_m$. For most points
within the control triangle $\mathbf p_m$ lies within the small triangle,
although this is not true in general and is not necessary to create a valid map
projection. (If $\mathbf v$ lies on a control triangle edge, one pair of circles
has a single point of intersection. One can draw a perpendicular through
that point of intersection and continue as in the general case.)

The equations of each perpendicular line, taken together, create a linear
system. It is an overdetermined system of 3 equations in 2 variables, but since
all 3 lines meet at the same point, it has a solution. Ultimately this system
can be solved for $\mathbf p_m$ to define a forward map projection as follows.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forward}% FIXME sign error?
\mathbf p_m =
\mathbf M \begin{bmatrix*} r^2_1 & r^2_2 & r^2_3 \end{bmatrix*}^\top,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forwardm}
\mathbf M = \frac{1}{2T}
\begin{bmatrix*} y_3 - y_2 & y_1 - y_3 & y_2 - y_1 \\
x_2 - x_3 & x_3 - x_1 & x_1 - x_2 \end{bmatrix*} = \frac{1}{2T}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 0 & -1  \\
1 & 0 \end{bmatrix*}
\mathbf P
\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 0 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix*},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:forwardt}
T = \begin{vmatrix*} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
 y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\
 1 & 1 & 1
\end{vmatrix*}.
\end{equation}
$T$ is equal to twice the area of the Euclidean control triangle.

The matrix $\mathbf M$ has a (right) nullspace spanned by the vector
$[1, 1, 1]^\top$. This implies the MTP is not one-to-one for all possible values
of $r_i$. For example, for any values of $r_i$ such that $r_1 = r_2 = r_3$, then
$\mathbf p_m = [0, 0]^\top$. The CTP and MTP project the entire sphere to a
bounded portion of the plane; the boundary of that portion can be termed the
boundary of the projection. There is a region of overlap that is mapped into
the same area but in reverse orientation.
That region includes the antipodes of the control points.
In real applications, the overlap region of the sphere can be excluded.

\section{Inverse projection}
Given $\mathbf p_m$, start to invert the projection as so:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inverse}
\begin{bmatrix*} k_1 & k_2 & k_3
\end{bmatrix*}^\top = \mathbf M^+ \mathbf p_m \,,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inversem}% FIXME sign error?
\mathbf M^+ = \frac{2}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r] 2x_1 - x_2 - x_3 & 2y_1 - y_2 - y_3 \\
-x_1 + 2x_2 - x_3 & -y_1 + 2y_2 - y_3 \\
-x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 & -y_1 - y_2 + 2y_3
\end{bmatrix*} = \frac{2}{3}
\begin{bmatrix*}[r] -2 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -2 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & -2
\end{bmatrix*}
\mathbf P^\top .
\end{equation}
$k_i = r^2_i - h$ for some value of the free parameter $h$. This is a general
solution to inverting Equation \ref{eq:forward}; $\mathbf M^+$ is the
pseudoinverse of $\mathbf M$ and vice versa. Because $\mathbf M^+$ has a left
nullspace spanned by the vector $[1, 1, 1]$, it follows that $\sum_i k_i = 0$,
and then that $h = \frac{1}{3}\sum_i r^2_i$.
These equations are not enough to determine $r_i$ and $\mathbf v$;
information about the sphere needs to be introduced.

To simplify the derivation, use $R=1$, such that distance on the surface of the
sphere has units of radians of arc. The circle of points $\mathbf v$ at
distance $r_i$ from a point $\mathbf v_i$ is simply the circle created by a
plane intersecting the sphere. Rearranging the distance function, this plane
may be specified as $\mathbf v_i \cdot \mathbf v = \cos\left(r_i\right).$
These planes combined together give a linear system. Thus,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inversev}
  \mathbf v = \mathbf V^{-1} \begin{bmatrix*} \cos\left(r_1\right) &
  \cos\left(r_2\right) &
  \cos\left(r_3\right)
  \end{bmatrix*}^\top .
\end{equation}

For the point to lie on the unit sphere, $\|\mathbf v\| = 1$. Let $\mathbf c$
be a vector with $i$th component $\cos\left(r_i \right)$. Then,
$\mathbf c^\top \left(\mathbf V^\top \mathbf V\right )^{-1} \mathbf c = 1$.
Make the substitution
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inverser}
  r_i = \sqrt{k_i + h} \,.
\end{equation} We now have an equation with one unknown, $h$.

Some obvious bounds can be placed on $h$. In units of radians,
$0 \le r_i \le \pi$. Since this must hold for every $r_i$, it follows that
\begin{equation}
   -\min_i k_i \le h \le \pi^2 - \max_i k_i \,.
\end{equation}
Within these bounds, there may be at most two solutions for $h$. The solution
with smaller $h$ is the desired one, and the one with larger $h$ corresponds to
the overlap region.

Let $\mathbf A = \left(\mathbf V^\top \mathbf V\right )^{-1}$ and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inversefh}
f(h) = \mathbf c^\top \mathbf A \mathbf c - 1 \,.
\end{equation}
The derivative of $f(h)$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inversefph}
  f'(h) = -\mathbf c^\top \mathbf A \mathbf b \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf b$ is a vector with $i$th component
$\mathrm{sinc}\left(\sqrt{k_i + h}\right)$.
Note that $f'(h)$ and $f(h)$ share many of the same terms,
which can be exploited for more efficient calculation.

The lower solution for $\mathbf p_m = [0, 0]^\top$ is a
global minimum for $h$, and can be calculated as so:
\begin{equation}
  h_0 = \arccos^2 \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum \mathbf A }} \right) ,
\end{equation}
where $\sum \mathbf A$ denotes the sum of all entries in the matrix $\mathbf A$.

Given all the preceding, Newton's method can be applied to solve for $h$.
A suitable initial condition is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inverseh}
  h_{\min} = \max \left(h_0, -\min_i k_i \right),
\end{equation}
which appears to consistently result in convergence to the lower root of $f(h)$.
One could use $\frac{1}{3}\sum_i l^2_i$,
where $l_i = |\mathbf p_m - \mathbf p_i|$ approximates $r_i$ fairly well,
but for some $\mathbf p_m$ outside the control triangle the iteration
converges to the wrong root.

A good approximation is achieved for points inside the control triangle within
a few iterations. Convergence is somewhat slower farther away from the
control triangle. At the boundary of the projection,
the lower solution and upper solution are the same and $f(h)=f'(h)=0$
so Newton's method converges at a merely linear rate. \citep{burden}

\section{Comparison}
The open-source C++ package PROJ \citep{proj} contains an implementation of the
CTP. We implemented the MTP as a patch to PROJ, to enable a fair comparison of
computation time, and to take advantage of the existing framework.

\citet{christensen} gave a list of control triangles for the CTP in that
paper's Table 1. The control triangles are repeated in this text's Table
\ref{table:ctrlpts}. These serve as a set of test cases for comparing the CTP
and MTP. The length of each side and the area of each triangle
(with the spherical approximation
given earlier) is also given, and the control triangles are sorted by area.

\label{table:ctrlpts}
\end{table}

To measure distortion of area and angle, we use the areal scale factor $s$ and
maximum angular deformation $\omega$ as defined in equations 12--15, 27, and 28
in section 4 of \citet{snyder87}. These are implemented in the
\verb|proj_factors()| function of PROJ, which estimates the derivatives
numerically. There is no standard measurement of distance distortion for map
projections, but for the projections in this text it makes sense to measure
distances from the control points. Let $r_i = d(\mathbf v_i, \mathbf v)$ be the
distance from $\mathbf v_i$ to $\mathbf v$ on the sphere, as earlier, and let
$\ell_i = \|\mathbf p_i - \mathbf p\|$ be the distance from $\mathbf p_i$ to
$\mathbf p$ in the plane.
Our new measure, the total distance deviation or $D$, is the sum of
differences in the distances measured on projected and unprojected distances:
\begin{equation}
 D = \sum_i \left| r_i - \ell_i \right|.
\end{equation}
We use the spherical approximation to the Earth, with a radius of 6,371 km,
approximately equal to the most common mean radii. \citep{snyder87}

For each spherical control triangle, summary statistics for $\omega$, $D$, and
$s$ are shown in Figures \ref{fig:omegap}--\ref{fig:scalep}. Note that the
control triangles are sorted by area in these figures as well.
These statistics are measured within the spherical control triangles,
and should not be taken to summarize the entire map; in most cases,
the region of interest extends outside the triangle.
Rather, the statistics allow a quantitative comparison of the two projections.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{omegaplot}
  \caption{Comparison of maximum angular deformation $\omega$.}
  \label{fig:omegap}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:omegap}, the MTP consistently has a larger $\omega$
than the CTP; in fact, the maximum $\omega$ for the CTP is near the average
$\omega$ for the MTP. Maximum and average $\omega$ trend upwards with control
triangle area, although asymmetry of the control triangle has some influence
too, as in the Canada triangles. The maximum $\omega$ for the MTP is about 3
times that for the CTP, and the average $\omega$ is about 3 to 4 times.
However, for moderately-sized triangles,
the maximum $\omega$ values are small for both projections, not exceeding 6°.
Even for the large triangles -- Africa, North America, and South America Wall
Maps -- the maximum distortion is tolerable, and the average does not exceed 6°.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{distanceplot}
  \caption{Comparison of total distance deviation $D$.}
  \label{fig:distancep}
\end{figure}

Total distance deviation $D$ in Figure \ref{fig:distancep} shows an even clearer
trend, monotonically increasing with triangle area. Both projections have the
same maximum $D$ values. The MTP has consistently lower average $D$ values than
the CTP; among these triangles, the maximum $D$ for the CTP is about
1.35 to 1.4 times the maximum $D$ for the MTP. The worst distortion,
Africa Wall Map's maximum $D$, is less than 5\% of its edge lengths, and
smaller control triangles have a maximum $D$ that is an even smaller percent.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{scaleplot}
  \caption{Comparison of areal scale ratio $\sigma$.}
  \label{fig:scalep}
\end{figure}

As true 1:1 scale maps are impractical, absolute values of $s$ are unimportant;
the quantity $\sigma = \frac{\max s}{\min s} - 1$ is plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:scalep} instead. The trend of $\sigma$ is less clear. A combination of
control triangle area and asymmetry influences this value. In general, this
value is higher for MTP than CTP, but not by any consistent factor,
and for the large and symmetric Africa Wall Map triangle the MTP is
actually lower than the CTP. The amount of scale distortion is small for both;
except for the very obtuse Canada Atlas triangle, all values are below 10\%.

A comparison of the two projections using the South America Wall Map control
points is in Figure \ref{fig:proj}.
The South America Wall Map control triangle is fairly
representative, being somewhat asymmetric but not too obtuse. The small part of
Central America in the upper left is somewhat shifted between the two maps, as
is the western area near Ecuador and Peru, but no features on either map are
conspicuously distorted compared to the other. Figure \ref{fig:tissot} shows
ellipses of distortion with centers on a grid at steps of 15° latitude and
longitude.
Distortion is somewhat more visible in this figure; one can see that the
MTP introduces slightly more non-conformal distortion near the control points.

  \label{fig:angle}
\end{figure}

Contour lines of $\omega$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:angle}. Those in the CTP
are ovals, while those for the MTP extend outward through each edge of the
control triangle. Both reach a minimum $\omega$ of 0 at a point inside the
control triangle. Highly obtuse control triangles, like Canada Atlas, may have
two local minima for $\omega$ within the control triangle. $\omega$ is higher
for MTP than CTP, except for a small region in the control triangle where both
are near 0 and some regions near the boundary of the map.

  \caption{Total distance deviation $D$. Blue dashed lines

  \label{fig:distance}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:distance} depicts contour lines of $D$ for these two
projections. Both projections have a local minimum of 0 at the control points,
which follows from the geometric construction. Both have a local maximum inside
the control triangle. $D$ for the MTP is low along the control
triangle edges, while for the CTP it is larger. $D$ is
lower for MTP than CTP in a region including the control triangle and
nearly all of South America, except for a small region near the shared maximum.
It is also lower in some regions extending outward from the control points.

\end{figure}

Contour lines of $s$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:scale}.
The contour lines have the same elliptical structure in both projections,
centered on a point where $s$ reaches a local minimum.
This point is different for each projection, which influences
the differences in aggregate area distortion in Figure \ref{fig:scalep}.
That minimum value of $s$ is different for each projection.

In most practical applications the area pictured in these figures will be
sufficient, but we can state trends as both projections extend outward from the
control triangle, outside the area shown in these figures. $\omega$ increases to
180° at the projection boundary, and increases further in the overlap region,
representing the inversion there. $D$ increases in general away from the center,
but for the MTP $D$ remains low on the great circles
containing the control triangle edges. $s$ is bounded for the entire sphere; it
increases to a maximum and then decreases to 0 at the projection boundary. If
continued into the overlap region, $s$ reaches a negative minimum value.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ l r r}
  Projection & Time (s) & Time minus overhead (s)\\
\hline
  CTP & 12.7 & 4.2 \\
  MTP & 10.8 & 2.3 \\
  No-op & 8.5 & 0.0
\end{tabular}
\caption{Computation time comparison.}

\end{table}

To determine computation time, a data set of 6,480,000 evenly spaced points
across the entire sphere was created. This includes points in the overlap
region, but different points do not take a different amount of time to
calculate. Neither does the control triangle itself affect computation time.
Table \ref{table:time} shows the time to project that data set using the
\texttt{proj} program in PROJ, as determined by the standard Unix command line
program \texttt{time}. The real-world calculation time is used rather than the
system or user time. These projections were run on the author's MacBook laptop.
There is no stochastic element to either projection: instead, error comes from
aspects of multitasking and data access external to the projections. This error
can only increase the time. Thus, the programs were run 10 times and the lowest
number was used. A certain amount of overhead comes from loading the program
into memory and reading the data from disk: fortunately, PROJ contains a no-op
projection that returns the input unchanged, and we can use that to measure the
overhead. Removing the overhead, the MTP is faster than the CTP by about 45\%.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated a new compromise map projection, the matrix trimetric
projection (MTP). In general, the differences between the results of the
Chamberlin trimetric projection (CTP) and MTP are small enough that either one
is adequate for their common use cases.
The MTP has the advantage if an inverse is needed,
if one wishes to reduce distance distortion, or if processing time is a concern.

The forward formula for the MTP is given in Equations
\ref{eq:forward}--\ref{eq:forwardt}. Equation \ref{eq:forward} is a simple
product of a matrix and a vector. The vector depends on the point being
transformed. The matrix calculated by the latter two equations depends only on
the control points, so can be calculated once and reused. The forward formula
does not have the special cases of the CTP, making it more efficient to
calculate and easier to program. The CTP also requires a step to calculate
azimuths involving the control points and the projected point,
which the MTP does not. Both projections share the same distance calculations,
which limits the degree to which they can differ. That said, when programmed in
the same language, the MTP is nearly twice as fast as the CTP. Of course,
exact differences in time depend on details of the implementation.

The inverse formula for the MTP is calculated by Equations
\ref{eq:inverse}--\ref{eq:inverser} and a single-variable Newton's method
iteration using Equations \ref{eq:inversefh} and \ref{eq:inversefph} with the
lower bound of Equation \ref{eq:inverseh} as an initial condition. The matrices
in Equations \ref{eq:inversem} and \ref{eq:inversev}, as well
as matrix $\mathbf A$ in Equations \ref{eq:inversefh} and \ref{eq:inversefph},
also depend only on the control points and can be reused. The CTP,
in contrast, has no known inverse aside from brute force two-variable inversion.

Figures \ref{fig:omegap}--\ref{fig:scalep} plot aggregate measures of distortion
within each of the listed control triangles. The CTP outperforms the MTP in
terms of angular distortion and (except in
one case) scale distortion, but the reverse is true for distance distortion. For
both projections, distortion tends to be larger for a larger control triangle.
Figures \ref{fig:proj}--\ref{fig:distance} show the projections applied to
South America, demonstrating the shape of distortions across the mapped area.
Differences between the two projections are difficult to see with the eye.

The same control points were used for both projections in this work, but the
optimal placement of control points may be somewhat different for the
application of different projections to the same geographic feature.
The angular distortion of the MTP is lower
in a region extending through the middle of the control triangle edges,
so one may wish to orient the triangle to take advantage of that.

The MTP is closely related to the CTP. Both are related to the azimuthal
equidistant projection and the two-point equidistant projection, which depend
on measurements from a single point and from a pair of points, respectively.
\citep{snyder87} This suggests an ``$n$-metric'' family of projections based on
distances from some number of points. The form of the forward formula suggests
a possible family of projections that are simple functions of such distances,
such as a polynomial function. Additionally, there may exist
similar projections using measurements other than distance, such as area.

A software implementation of the MTP, as well as code used to
produce the calculations and figures in this text,
is available on the author's Github site. \citep{blind}%\citep{brsrmapproj}
