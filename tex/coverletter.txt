Dear Dr. Delmelle

I wish to submit an original research article entitled "A variation on the Chamberlin trimetric map projection" for consideration by the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science. I confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere, nor is it currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

This paper demonstrates a new map projection, the Matrix Trimetric projection. This projection improves on the closely-related Chamberlin Trimetric map projection. The Matrix Trimetric projection's forward formula is nearly twice as fast in a software implementation, and unlike the Chamberlin Trimetric it has an easy-to-calculate inverse. This comes at the cost of very small increases in area and angle distortion; like the Chamberlin Trimetric projection, it can be used to create maps on the scale of continents without conspicuously visible distortion. Your readers will find the Matrix Trimetric projection a useful new choice for such maps.

This paper cites an earlier article in your journal – Christensen, A. H. (1992). The chamberlin trimetric projection. Cartography and Geographic Information Systems, 19(2), 88-100 – and makes use of the geographic coordinates that paper's Table 1. As per Taylor and Francis's guidelines on third-party material, I believe citing the earlier article is sufficient. Of course, I will defer to your opinion on this matter.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Please address all correspondence concerning this manuscript to me at brstone@gmail.com.

Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript.

Sincerely,
